## Recent Fixes and Improvements

Several critical issues have been addressed in the most recent update:

1. **Relationship Consistency**: 
   - Fixed missing relationship between User and Embedding models that was causing SQLAlchemy initialization errors
   - Ensured proper bidirectional relationships between all interconnected models

2. **Schema Alignment**:
   - Updated Pydantic schemas to match SQLAlchemy model field names
   - Fixed field name discrepancies in the following schemas:
     - Prompt schema (`created_by` → `creator_id`)
     - Tool schema (`created_by` → `creator_id`)
     - Document schema (`created_by` → `creator_id`)
     - VectorDB schema (`created_by` → `creator_id`)
     - RAGSystem schema (`created_by` → `creator_id`)

3. **Frontend Interface Alignment**:
   - Updated all frontend API client interfaces to use `creator_id` instead of `created_by`
   - Fixed data serialization inconsistencies when sending/receiving data between frontend and backend
   - Ensured proper API response handling in component initialization

4. **Navigation Improvements**:
   - Enhanced sidebar navigation to properly highlight active sections
   - Fixed routing issues that required manual page refreshes
   - Improved UI state management during page transitions

5. **Authentication System**:
   - Corrected authentication flow to use existing database fields
   - Improved error handling for authentication failures

6. **Database Compatibility**:
   - Ensured all model changes are backward compatible with existing database structure
   - Fixed SQL errors related to missing or mismatched fields

7. **API Consistency**:
   - Standardized field naming across all API endpoints
   - Improved response validation for create/update operations

## March 2025 Bugfixes: Prompt Creation and Authentication

The following critical issues have been fixed to enable prompt creation functionality and improve authentication:

1. **Tags Serialization Fix**:
   - Updated Pydantic schemas in `/backend/app/schemas/prompt.py` to properly handle tags field serialization
   - Added validators to convert between string representation and actual list objects
   - Implemented proper JSON serialization/deserialization for tags
   - Fixed response model validation for list type fields

2. **Authentication System Compatibility**:
   - Added an `is_active` property to User model in `/backend/app/models/user.py` to provide backward compatibility
   - Updated `/backend/app/api/dependencies/auth.py` to use `current_user.disabled` instead of non-existent `is_active` field
   - Fixed authentication flow to work properly with existing database schema

3. **Pydantic v2 Compatibility**:
   - Updated schema Config classes to use `from_attributes = True` instead of deprecated `orm_mode = True`
   - Added `populate_by_name = True` to ensure proper field aliasing
   - Fixed response serialization for nested objects and lists

4. **Prompt Edit Routing Fix** (March 28, 2025):
   - Fixed the frontend routing system in `/frontend/src/App.svelte` to properly handle paths with IDs
   - Added a `getBasePath` function to correctly extract the base route path from URLs with IDs
   - Added an `getIdFromPath` helper to extract entity IDs from paths
   - Updated the component rendering logic to properly pass IDs to editor components
   - Fixed "Page Not Found" error when attempting to edit existing prompts

These changes ensure that prompt creation and editing work correctly and that user authentication functions properly throughout the application, resolving the 500 Internal Server Errors and routing issues encountered previously.

We're adding comprehensive role-based access control to allow workshop administrators and instructors to manage attendees and control access to platform resources. This will be a multi-phase implementation.

### RBAC Phase 1: Database Model Updates

#### 1. User Model Enhancement (`/backend/app/models/user.py`)

```python
# Update User model to include roles and permissions
class UserRole(str, Enum):
    SUPER_ADMIN = "super_admin"   # Full platform control
    ADMIN = "admin"               # Workshop administration
    INSTRUCTOR = "instructor"     # Workshop facilitation 
    STUDENT = "student"           # Workshop attendee
    FAMILY = "family"             # Family member (for parental controls)
    GUEST = "guest"               # Limited access user

# Add to User model:
role = Column(Enum(UserRole), default=UserRole.GUEST)
is_active = Column(Boolean, default=False)  # For approval workflow
approved_by = Column(String, ForeignKey("users.id"), nullable=True)
approved_at = Column(DateTime, nullable=True)
```

#### 2. Resource Permission Tables (`/backend/app/models/permissions.py`)

```python
# Create new file for association tables
user_models = Table(
    "user_models",
    Base.metadata,
    Column("user_id", String, ForeignKey("users.id", ondelete="CASCADE")),
    Column("model_id", String, ForeignKey("models.id", ondelete="CASCADE")),
    Column("created_at", DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow),
)

user_tools = Table(
    "user_models",
    Base.metadata,
    Column("user_id", String, ForeignKey("users.id", ondelete="CASCADE")),
    Column("tool_id", String, ForeignKey("tools.id", ondelete="CASCADE")),
    Column("created_at", DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow),
)

# Additional tables for prompts, documents, etc.
```

### RBAC Phase 2: Schema Updates

#### 1. User Schema Enhancement (`/backend/app/schemas/user.py`)

```python
# Add to UserBase schema:
role: Optional[UserRole] = Field(default=UserRole.GUEST)

# Create new schemas
class UserApproval(BaseModel):
    approved: bool
    role: UserRole = UserRole.STUDENT  
    allowed_model_ids: List[str] = []
    allowed_tool_ids: List[str] = []
    admin_notes: Optional[str] = None

class UserWithPermissions(User):
    allowed_models: List[Dict[str, Any]] = []
    allowed_tools: List[Dict[str, Any]] = []
```

### RBAC Phase 3: Auth Dependencies

#### 1. Enhanced Auth Dependencies (`/backend/app/api/dependencies/auth.py`)

```python
# Add role-based dependencies
def get_admin_user(current_user: User = Depends(get_current_active_user)) -> User:
    """Check if current user is an admin."""
    if current_user.role not in [UserRole.ADMIN, UserRole.SUPER_ADMIN]:
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=status.HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Admin privileges required"
        )
    return current_user

def get_user_with_role(*allowed_roles: UserRole):
    """Factory for role-based access control dependency."""
    async def check_user_role(current_user: User = Depends(get_current_active_user)) -> User:
        if not allowed_roles or current_user.role not in allowed_roles:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=status.HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
                detail=f"Role {current_user.role} not authorized to access this resource"
            )
        return current_user
    return check_user_role
```

### RBAC Phase 4: Service Layer Implementation

#### 1. User Service Enhancement (`/backend/app/services/user_service.py`)

```python
# Add new user service methods:
async def approve_user(
    db: Session,
    user: User,
    approved: bool,
    role: UserRole,
    allowed_model_ids: List[str],
    allowed_tool_ids: List[str],
    admin_id: str,
    admin_notes: Optional[str] = None
) -> User:
    """Approve or reject a user."""
    # Implementation details here

async def get_pending_users(
    db: Session,
    skip: int = 0,
    limit: int = 100
) -> Tuple[List[User], int]:
    """Get all pending (disabled) users."""
    return await get_users(db, skip=skip, limit=limit, is_active=False)

# Add related methods for managing permissions
```

### RBAC Phase 5: API Endpoint Implementation

#### 1. Admin Routes (`/backend/app/api/v1/admin.py`)

```python
# Create new router for admin functions
router = APIRouter(prefix="/api/v1/admin", tags=["admin"])

@router.get("/users/pending", response_model=UserList)
async def list_pending_users(
    skip: int = Query(0, ge=0),
    limit: int = Query(100, ge=1, le=100),
    current_user: User = Depends(get_admin_user),
    db: Session = Depends(get_db)
):
    """Get all pending users awaiting approval."""
    users, total = await get_pending_users(db, skip=skip, limit=limit)
    return {"items": users, "total": total}

@router.post("/users/{user_id}/approve", response_model=User)
async def approve_user_registration(
    user_id: str = Path(...),
    approval: UserApproval = Body(...),
    current_user: User = Depends(get_admin_user),
    db: Session = Depends(get_db)
):
    """Approve or reject a user registration."""
    # Implementation details
```

### RBAC Phase 6: Frontend Implementation

#### 1. Admin Dashboard (`/frontend/src/pages/admin/Dashboard.svelte`)

Create a new admin dashboard with user management interface:
- List of all users by role
- Pending approvals section
- User detail view with permission management
- Resource access control interface

#### 2. User Registration Flow (`/frontend/src/pages/auth/Register.svelte`)

Update registration flow to:
- Collect additional user information
- Display "pending approval" message
- Notify admins of new registrations

### RBAC Phase 7: Testing & Documentation
