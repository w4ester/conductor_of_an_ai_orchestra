# Production Readiness Fixes

This document outlines the fixes and improvements made to prepare the Ollama Workshop Platform for production:

## 1. Database Migration Fixes

- Created a manual initial migration script (`41e25ffba876_initial_migration.py`) to define the database schema
- Fixed the Alembic configuration to properly recognize all models
- Set up database tables for all entities (users, prompts, tools, documents, embeddings, etc.)

## 2. API Structure Modernization

- Rewrote the main application file (`main.py`) to use the proper API router structure
- Updated the API router initialization to include all endpoint modules
- Fixed dependency paths and imports in router files

## 3. Authentication & Security

- Updated authentication dependencies in `app/api/dependencies/users.py`
- Fixed token validation with proper JWT handling and time checking
- Updated user schemas to match the SQLAlchemy models

## 4. Configuration Management

- Added environment-based configuration with a `.env` file
- Created a `.env.example` template for new installations
- Configured environment variables for database, security, and API settings

## 5. Deployment Infrastructure

- Added Docker setup with separate containers for:
  - Backend (FastAPI with Gunicorn/Uvicorn)
  - Frontend (Svelte with NGINX)
  - Ollama (for model serving)
- Created appropriate Dockerfiles with optimized settings
- Added an NGINX configuration for proper static file serving and SPA routing
- Created a `docker-compose.yml` file for orchestrating all services

## 6. Documentation

- Updated the README.md with comprehensive instructions
- Added development and production setup guides
- Documented available features and technologies

## Next Steps

While the current fixes have addressed the most critical production readiness issues, the following items still need attention:

1. **Service Layer Completion**: Ensure all service modules contain the necessary business logic
2. **Testing Framework**: Add comprehensive unit and integration tests
3. **Logging Configuration**: Configure structured logging for production
4. **Monitoring Setup**: Add health checks and monitoring endpoints
5. **Error Handling**: Implement consistent error handling across all endpoints
6. **Performance Optimization**: Add caching and query optimization
7. **Frontend API Integration**: Update frontend API client to use the new endpoints

These improvements have significantly enhanced the production readiness of the Ollama Workshop Platform while maintaining compatibility with the existing codebase.
